# Overview Project name :Kaizen Muscle

In this project, I will make record mobile app for working out in React Natives. It is for the first time to make mobile app and use React Natives, so the objective is keep it simple and functional first. This app, Kaizen Muscle, can record the workout items, intensity, reps, and sets for workout itself, and body weight, the contents of each meal, calculate calories and PFC balance, and list up them by calendar.

This is the programmings which I made
1. User can input items
2. The data is saved and display by specific order (so far, by date)
3. Keep it simple, but extendable.
